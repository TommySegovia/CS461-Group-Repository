                        <p>This test is maximal and comes with risk to the user. Always start at a relatively low
                            load, which usually means start with less than or equal to your own bodyweight, and gradually increase the weight.
                            If your form begins to fail such that you feel your hand begin to slip or half crimp opening,
                            return back to standing flat on the ground and use a lower weight. Remember! Safety is
                            always more important than potentially risking an injury!</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="my-3">Before you start, insure that you are properly warmed up.
                        Pick which grip position works the best for you. This means
                        whichever one is comofortable or perhaps what you're most familar with. If you're not sure, give
                        both a try!</p>

                        You may use a dipping belt or climbing harness to add additional weight to your body and attempt
                        another 7 second hang. It is recommended that you add between 1kg and 5kg or 2lbs and 5lbs
                        depending on how the previous hang felt to you.
