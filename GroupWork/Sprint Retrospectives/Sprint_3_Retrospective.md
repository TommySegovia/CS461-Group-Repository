## SPRINT 3 RETROSPECTIVE
### April 3, 2024

### Loved
- I loved my implementation for the styling for the Area/Climbing pages and I hope to expand on that.
- Team collaboration on keeping data models and database scripts updated for ease of database recreation.
- I liked how GraphQL allows you to make custom API calls that are more efficient than standard REST APIs.
- I was happy with how my user story came together
- I was glad that I was able to refactor a lot of the code and it helped with the rest of my story work

### Longed for
- Spring Break
- Better test coverage
- More testing skills
- Able to find avenues for testing javascript using jest
- More query endpoints within the OpenBeta API

### Loathed
- That I ended up taking on a four pointer that blossomed into a 8 pointer due to the amount of work that needed to be done rather than its complexity.
- One of my stories ended up being much larger than I expected
- Some difficulties with database migrations and keeping the db model up to date across local and deployed versions.
- Difficulty doing refactoring and extricating properties from models.

### Learned
- I learned about refactoring JS into more manageable modules. 
- I learned more about creating better user stories.
- Learned more about reseeding and applying migrations to the azure databases.
- Being more generous with the size of a user story when the scope is more complex

### Milestones
- I ended up improving on my test coverage and understanding where testing needed to take place. 
- We got the OpenBeta API to work and produce results within our web app via searching and specific pages for climbs/areas with data.
- Understanding the importance of keeping the scalability of the code you write in mind when writing code such as refactoring and abstracting code with modules/methods/classes.
- Being more thoughtful about where and how class properties and our data model is designed.

### Actions
- Look for ways to implement Jest testing for Javascript more going forward.
- Really trying to slice down user stories and not end up thinking a 4 pointer really is an 8.
- Doing more research beforehand to realistically determine scope and complexity of user stories.
