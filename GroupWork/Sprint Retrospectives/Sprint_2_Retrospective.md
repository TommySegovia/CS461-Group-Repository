## Sprint 2 Retrospective
#### March 5, 2024

### Loved
- I loved that my user stories felt reasonably sized and self contained
- I loved that my user stories did not have many dependencies
- I loved that my user stories were reasonably related to each other, but not reliant on each other.
- I loved how I managed to figure out and implement my user story that was a bit more complex than I expected

### Longed for
- More forethought on the layout of my pages
- More css skills
- More time and more clarity on specifications on some areas of my user stories.
- I wish doing html/css didn’t take as long to actually accomplish.

### Loathed
- I did not like how overly specific a few of the details were on my acceptance criteria
- How long my particular user-story took to complete
- How long it took to implement tests, it felt like I had to know a lot about very specific functions just to get a single test to pass.
- Some of my user stories lacked enough value for the end user, and were misallocated effort that could have been avoided with deeper planning.

### Learned
- To prepare user accounts with the appropriate data seeded/pre-populated before the sprint review meeting.
- I learned more about how identity works, such as the scaffolding and page layout
- I learned how to create specific routes that would allow for templated pages that would be filled out based on a user’s data.
- How to create graphs that are populated with our datasets using the ScottPlot library.

### Milestones
- Deployment was smoother, and there was more collaborative time to solve deployment issues. 
- Completing 2FA was very satisfying once I was able to get the qr code reader library to work
- Getting the profiles finished was a big feature implemented in our sprint and overall project that allows for more user-story related to that functionality which will deliver more value in the future.

### Actions
- Will create seed scripts and create / seed user data wherever appropriate to make for smoother demonstrations at the sprint review meeting.
- Will add dropping the asp users into our down script.
- Will add more information into the jira user stories about the practical layout of logging/analysis features.
- Will prioritize adding more value into each user story.
