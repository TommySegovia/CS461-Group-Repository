## SPRINT 5 RETROSPECTIVE
### April 30th, 2024

### Loved
- I loved how well the images for the climbing locations integrated with the existing website. 
- I liked how logging the climbing attempts and seeing them on the locations page looked in the end.
- I am happy with how the location pages have turned out.
- I like how many API endpoints we have now, so it makes adding more functionality that uses similar data very easy
- I’m happy about the way ownership for community groups worked out

### Longed for
- More time, much more time. Too little time to really do anything but the bare minimum sometimes.
- Javascript not to be a pain.
- More time in the beginning of the sprint, I had to cram a bit towards the end.
- Images would load more cleanly on the website when deployed.

### Loathed
- I don’t like how javascript interacts with the DOM in a sort of black box manner with asynchronous functions, it can be really difficult to predict when things are loading server-side and when javascript is loading things client-side. I have had a lot of problems with javascript not being able to find elements on the page.
- Bootstrap modals are finicky as heck sometimes. I spent 3+ hours working on just getting to close using javascript.
- I don’t like how difficult it is to work outside of the css container.
- Microsoft

### Learned
- I learned a lot about how to deploy a website, databases using a cloud service like Azure.
- I learned a lot more about how migrations should work with code being king via .sql scripts to manage the databases.
- I learned how migrations work and how they are sequential updates in response to the database and it’s structure

### Milestones
- Location pages included the search page, climbs, and areas are nearly fully featured and look professional!
- Usernames are now fully connected throughout the site without redundancy
- Community groups are now set up to be built upon.
- BDD testing now runs with a persistent web driver instance, so BDD testing runs much quicker.

### Actions
- Will need to learn how to use continuous deployment with our github repo.
- For next sprint will need to tackle polishing up the website with some small needed features on my end.
- Improve BDD testing skills when it comes to setting up background and data tables for easier testing.
