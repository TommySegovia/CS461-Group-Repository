## SPRINT 6 RETROSPECTIVE
### May 14th, 2024

### Loved
- I like how the tagging system looks like on the climbs
- The climbing log looks pretty good now with easy viewing with pagination
- I like that we have a lot of good API endpoints that are easy to work with and reuse.
- Finally getting continuous deployments to work and as part of our project now

### Longed for
- 4 group members.
- More intuitive workflow with azure, github, git, and our repository. Sometimes it can be confusing to know what I need with Azure because it really has a lot of features and most I just somewhat or don’t understand.
- More skills in presentation and design.
- More time to do more tests

### Loathed
- Overnighters…
- HTML/CSS wonkiness
- Modals continue to suck
- BDD testing for 2 of my stories

### Learned
- API endpoints that rely on other API calls need to await responses.
- How to setup continuous development.
- What is needed for BDD testing: make the tests go through the process like a user (logging tests/climbs).

### Milestones
- Got Climbing tags functionality working.
- Report page looks a bit better.
- Climbing Logs are becoming intuitive and filled out
- Location page looks really fully featured (and all the other pages under it)

### Actions
- Fix styling and presentation
- Fix bugs with the site
- Add another feature for the profile/community pages
- Add algorithmic component
