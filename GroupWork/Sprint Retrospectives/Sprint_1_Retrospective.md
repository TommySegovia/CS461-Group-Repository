# SPRINT 1 RETROSPECTIVE

## Loved
- Learning how to work as a team in a software development environment.
- Collaborating and open communication to define project goals/details.
- I liked having Copilot help out when I got really stuck or didn't understand something.
- I liked the scope of my work.
- I liked the finished product of the front-end.



## Longed for
- Less dependencies
- I wish my loans would pay themselves.
- More time!!!!!!!!!!!
- I wish our burndown chart was more near the ideal.
- Knowing how many points a user-story is worth.


## Loathed
- I don't like HTML/CSS sometimes, it can be so finicky, and things take longer than they really should when solving small visual issues.
- Dependencies.
- Larger than expected user stories.
- Rushing at the end for deployment.
- Writing user stories without having much practice in writing them.


## Learned
- Starting early on deployments/integration.
- Give yourself enough time to complete each story.
- Communicating early on issues or ideas.
- How to communicate and work in a team environment rather than by myself.
- The Agile/Scrum Development Process.
- How to write better user-stories.
- Have a more detailed backlog for the sprint review meeting.


## Milestones
- Getting the app landing page set-up was nice and started to give the app an identity.
- Getting the logging and reports working for the user tests.
- Getting the identity to work and properly allow for users to register and log-in.



## Actions
- We will start early on integration, and immediately ensure features are deployed and successfully integrated during their review phase as part of their acceptance criteria. All completed features should be successfully deployed at least 24 hours before the end of the sprint.
- Thoroughly detailing the scope and requirements of user stories to reduce dependencies and unexpected size of stories.
- We will cover our user stories more thoroughly during our Sprint Backlog meeting by writing out most of the details during and soon after the meeting, so that they are ready to be reviewed during the Sprint Review meeting and only needing some small adjustments during the Sprint Planning meeting.
